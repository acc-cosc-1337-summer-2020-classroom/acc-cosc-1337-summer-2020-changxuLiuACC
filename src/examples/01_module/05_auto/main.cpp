int main() 
{
    //auto works like the way variables work in python, it automatically assigns the best data type
    //and you don't have to declare it yourself
    
    auto num = 1; //becomes an int data type
    auto dec = 5.5; //becomes a double data type
    auto ch = 'a'; //becomes a char data type

    //this is what they're pushing for to attract new programmers, the industry may be moving towards this
    //no advantage to auto vs. manual, compiler is still very fast

    //but can't just define a variable without assigning it a value as it won't know what data type to give it
    //same with function parameters, there's no way for it to figure out
